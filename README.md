## 📈 Insights & Findings

1. Overall Decline in Casualties
   - Total casualties dropped by ~12%, with fatal casualties showing the sharpest decline (-33%).  
   - This suggests improvements in road safety measures and possibly stricter enforcement or better vehicle safety.

2. Cars Dominate Accidents
   - Cars account for ~80% of all casualties (155K), far higher than any other vehicle type.  
   - Road safety initiatives should prioritize private car usage patterns.

3. Urban Areas are Riskier
   - Nearly 62% of casualties happen in urban areas, highlighting congestion, pedestrian interaction, and dense traffic flow as key risk factors.

4. Daytime Accidents are More Frequent
   - 73% of casualties occur during the day, possibly due to higher traffic volume compared to nighttime.

5. Road Type Impact
   - Single carriageways contribute to the largest share of casualties (145K).  
   - Safer road design and improved traffic management could reduce risks on these roads.

## 📌 Recommendations

- Enhance Car Safety Programs: Focus on driver education, speed management, and urban traffic enforcement.  
- Urban Safety Measures: Introduce more pedestrian crossings, traffic calming strategies, and stricter monitoring in high-density urban zones.  
- Single Carriageway Improvements: Consider widening, better signage, and installation of barriers to minimize head-on collisions.  
- Promote Safe Driving During Peak Hours: Since most accidents occur during the day, awareness campaigns during rush hours could be effective.
